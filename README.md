# R_data_manipulation
The main idea of this project was to create a tool that allowed a simple visualization and manipulation of a raw data

The project was developed in R and uses the Shiny library to allow the user interface. It is composed by 4 tabs, which have the follow objectives:

1 Tab - Raw Data

The main objective of this tab it to allow the user to see the data that he is working with. For that, a scatter plot and a histogram of all raw variables are available.

2 Tab - Variables Manipulation

 

This tab is responsible for the creation of new drivers. To form a new driver you need to give it a name and sellect the desired information.

The lateral table serves as a metadata, once it shows for all variables the transformation done to form it.



 

3 Tab - Data Overview

 

This tab shows all the requested statistics for all drivers. Here it is possible to see the normality/stationary test and check the correlations.



 

4 Tab - Variables graphs

 

Finally, the last tab shows the variables in the same graph in order to allow a visual comparison.
